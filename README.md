This Project is targeted to python students who want to learn python directly
by involving in real-world problems. It contains all the project requirements,
guideline to do the project and a sample solution of the specific problem.

You are strongly encouraged to solve problems on your own way. The solution here
is just a way to solve problems. If you want to solve problems or correct them,
you're always welcome to create a PR. I'll be accepting your PRs and you'll be
able to support and contribute to open-learning.


The project is classified into 3 different categories Basic, Intermediate, and
expert projects. To start basic projects, you need to have knowledge of at least
